Diff is useful for finding differenes in files
 - also show a few pre and post code lines

Accessing full versions of file makes me a better programmer, because:
 - see where I made mistakes
 - re-use things I did well

Manually making commits
  - forces you to think in chunks, as you want your commits in logical chunks

Git log
  - see list of the commits, dates and notes

Git diff --stat
   - see list stats of changes: insertions & deletions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
 - checkout and and run prevoius versions ... or clone original and keep checkout one by one till find bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
 - coding versions of OPI App
 - syncing Reaper repos
 - synching different profiles or applications
